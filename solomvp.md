        return "af"
    return "en"

# üö® **Reality Checks & Warnings**

## **You WILL Want to Over-Engineer**
When you think: *"Let me add machine learning training"*
**STOP!** Use OpenAI API instead.

When you think: *"I need perfect offline sync"*
**STOP!** Basic storage is fine for MVP.

When you think: *"Let me support 5 languages"*
**STOP!** Perfect one language first.

## **Budget Reality** (12 weeks)
- **Hosting**: $20/month √ó 3 months = $60
- **Twilio**: $50/month √ó 3 months = $150  
- **OpenAI**: $100/month √ó 3 months = $300
- **Stripe**: $0 (pay-as-you-go)
- **Total**: ~$500 for 12 weeks

**Break even**: 15 customers √ó $35 = $525/month

## **Time Reality** 
- **Full-time**: 40 hours/week √ó 12 weeks = 480 hours
- **Part-time**: 20 hours/week √ó 24 weeks = 480 hours
- **Weekend warrior**: 16 hours/week √ó 30 weeks = 480 hours

**Choose your pace, but stick to it!**
